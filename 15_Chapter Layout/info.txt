Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens)

page LAYOUT 390
These two pages illustrate a 960
pixel wide, 12 column grid. They
demonstrate how it is possible
to create a wide range of column
layouts using this one grid.

The page is 960 pixels wide and
there are 12 equal sized columns
(shown in gray), each of which is
is 60 pixels wide

Each column has a margin set
to 10 pixels, which creates a a
gap of 20 pixels between each
column and 10 pixels to the left
and right-hand sides of the page.

summary
Layout
X <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
X Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
X The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
X Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
X Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
X Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
X CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
X You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
